## Idea 
The project is a React-based full-stack web application, which brings teaching and learning together. The application can be used by teachers to share Books, notices, Lecture-Notes, Video lectures etc. with their students. This application works in such a way that teacher needs to login with their credentials and then the class materials can be uploaded there. This application also provides the feature of updating and deleting the posted material. further, students can go to the website and view, like, and download their materials. In the newer version of the application the features of searching and commenting can be added easily.
